## Project Overview

This project is a lightweight, AI-powered web application that assesses the strength of user-entered passwords in real time. It uses a Random Forest machine learning model trained on a synthetic dataset to classify passwords into categories: **Weak**, **Medium**, **Strong**, and **Very Strong**.

The application combines a Python CGI backend for prediction logic with a responsive HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend, delivering instant feedback and improvement suggestions without relying on heavy web frameworks.

---

## Features

- Secure password strength classification using machine learning
- Real-time interactive feedback as the user types
- SHA-256 hashing of passwords for secure display purposes
- Suggestions to help users improve weak or medium-strength passwords
- Pure Python and vanilla JS implementation with CGI for easy deployment
- Synthetic dataset generation and model training scripts included

---

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.8+
- Scikit-learn (Random Forest Classifier)
- Pickle (for model serialization)
- Python built-in CGI module
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (vanilla) for frontend
- Pythonâ€™s built-in HTTP server (`http.server`) with CGI support
